This scatter plot, titled "Word Embeddings Visualization (Life Insurance Terms)," helps illustrate how different life insurance-related terms are semantically related in a reduced-dimensional space using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Each term is represented by a data point positioned based on its word embedding.
- The closer two terms are, the stronger their semantic relationship.
- Terms like "policy," "coverage," and "beneficiary" are positioned near each other, likely because they frequently co-occur and have similar meanings in insurance contexts.
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA allows us to visualize high-dimensional embeddings in a 2D space, helping interpret semantic clusters.

- This graph shows how insurance-related words are connected based on meaning and usage.
- Words that often appear together or have similar meanings are placed closer.
- For example, "claim" and "approval" are near each other because claims often require approval in insurance.
- "Investment" and "returns" are related because insurance often includes financial benefits.
- This helps computers understand words the way humans doâ€”by relationships, rather than just dictionary definitions.
