This PCA scatter chart visualizes the relationships between several words—man, woman, king, queen, and is—using their word embeddings reduced to two principal components (PCA Component 1 and 2).

What’s shown:

Closeness = Semantic Similarity:
Words that are close together on the chart have similar meanings or are used in similar contexts in the corpus the embeddings were trained on.

"Gender" Direction:
man and woman are closer to each other, showing their semantic similarity (both are human, gendered nouns).

king and queen are paired as royal terms, also reflecting gendered distinctions.
The queen point sits closer to woman, and king is slightly further but still in the "royalty" direction. This is typical: the vector difference between "king" and "queen" often mirrors the difference between "man" and "woman" in well-trained embeddings.

"Is" as a Common Word:
The word is is not semantically close to the others (it’s a verb, not a noun), but because it appears with all types of words, its embedding may end up somewhat central or near the rest in a simple toy model.

Interpretation in Embedding Space:
The distances between points illustrate how a model "understands" the relationships between these words.

In richer, higher-dimensional embedding spaces, directions can capture relationships like:
king − man + woman ≈ queen
This famous example shows that you can do arithmetic on word vectors to find analogies.

PCA’s Role:
PCA reduces the high-dimensional embeddings (maybe 50, 100, or 300+ dimensions) down to just 2, preserving as much of the overall variation as possible.
The axes ("PCA Component 1" and "PCA Component 2") don’t directly map to semantic features (like gender or royalty), but similar words and relationships should cluster or align together.

Summary:
This chart provides a 2D visual summary of how similar or different the words are in meaning, according to their learned embeddings. Words like man/woman and king/queen cluster as expected, showing that word embeddings can capture both gender and category (royalty, human, etc.) relationships, even in two dimensions.


More on equation king − man + woman ≈ queen
This equation represents a classic example of word vector arithmetic in word embeddings, specifically using models like Word2Vec. The idea is that words can be represented as multi-dimensional vectors where semantic relationships are preserved.
- In models like Word2Vec, words are mapped to a vector space, where similar words have closer vector representations.
- The equation king - man + woman ≈ queen demonstrates gender-based relationships in word embeddings.
- Conceptually, the vector difference between "king" and "man" represents masculinity or royalty, while adding "woman" shifts the meaning toward the female equivalent, "queen".
- This principle is used in NLP tasks like analogy solving, where embeddings capture semantic relationships without explicit rules.

- Think of it like a word puzzle: if "king" is to "man" as "queen" is to "woman", then removing "man" from "king" and adding "woman" should give "queen".
- AI learns relationships between words based on how they are used in sentences.
- These relationships allow AI to understand and generate human-like responses, such as suggesting synonyms or filling in missing words in a sentence.
