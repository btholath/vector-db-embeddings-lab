## Similarity Metrics
Cosine Similiarity 
Description: Measures the angle between vectors, focusing on direction
Usage:  Text analysis and high-dimensional spaces where direction is key

Euclidean Distance
Description: Calculates the straight-line distance between points, considering both direction and magnitude
Usage:  Clustering and classification in low-dimensional spaces.
